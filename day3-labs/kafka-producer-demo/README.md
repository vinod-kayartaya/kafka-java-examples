# Kafka Producer Deep Dive

## Reference Guide for TransactionProducer_V1 to TransactionProducer_V6

---

# Introduction

In an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), producers are responsible for publishing events to Kafka topics. These events can represent business activities such as:

* Payment completed
* Order created
* Customer registered
* Shipment dispatched
* Fraud detected

The examples in this guide use a simple Payment Processing System where transaction events are published to a Kafka topic named:

```text
transactions
```

Each successive producer version introduces a new Kafka concept while building on the previous version.

---

# Version 1: Basic Producer

## Learning Objective

Understand the minimum code required to publish an event to Kafka.

---

## Business Scenario

A payment application publishes completed transaction events.

```text
Payment Service
      |
      V
Kafka Producer
      |
      V
transactions Topic
```

---

## Key Kafka Concepts

* KafkaProducer
* ProducerRecord
* Topic
* Serialization

---

## Core Code

```java
KafkaProducer<String,String> producer =
        new KafkaProducer<>(props);
```

Creates a producer instance.

---

```java
ProducerRecord<String,String> record =
        new ProducerRecord<>(
                topic,
                json);
```

Creates a message.

---

```java
producer.send(record);
```

Publishes the message.

---

## What Happens Internally?

```text
Application
     |
Create Record
     |
Serialize JSON
     |
Send To Kafka
     |
Broker Stores Event
```

---

## Advantages

* Very simple
* Easy to understand
* Suitable for prototypes

---

## Limitation

The application does not know:

* Which partition received the message
* Whether Kafka stored it successfully
* What offset was assigned

---

## Real-World Use Cases

* Logging systems
* Telemetry data
* Demo applications
* Low criticality events

---

# Version 2: Synchronous Producer

## Learning Objective

Learn how Kafka acknowledges message delivery.

---

## Business Scenario

A banking application must know that a transaction was stored before continuing.

---

## New Concepts

* Future
* RecordMetadata
* Acknowledgements
* Offsets
* Partitions

---

## Core Code

```java
RecordMetadata metadata =
        producer.send(record).get();
```

The call blocks until Kafka acknowledges the write.

---

## Metadata Available

```java
metadata.topic();
metadata.partition();
metadata.offset();
metadata.timestamp();
```

---

## Execution Flow

```text
Producer
   |
Send Event
   |
Wait
   |
Broker Stores Event
   |
Acknowledgement
   |
Continue
```

---

## Benefits

* Reliable
* Easy to reason about
* Suitable for critical operations

---

## Drawbacks

The application waits for every message.

```text
Send
Wait

Send
Wait

Send
Wait
```

This reduces throughput.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

* Banking
* Payments
* Insurance claims
* Regulatory systems

---

# Version 3: Asynchronous Producer

## Learning Objective

Understand non-blocking publishing.

---

## Business Scenario

A payment platform processes thousands of transactions per second.

Waiting after every send would slow the system down.

---

## New Concepts

* Callback
* Asynchronous execution
* Throughput optimization

---

## Core Code

```java
producer.send(
        record,
        (metadata, exception) -> {

            if(exception == null) {

                System.out.println(
                        metadata.offset());
            }
        });
```

---

## Execution Flow

```text
Producer
   |
Send
   |
Continue Working
   |
Callback Invoked Later
```

---

## Benefits

Higher throughput

```text
Sync Producer
-------------
Send
Wait
Send
Wait

Async Producer
--------------
Send
Send
Send
Send
Callback
Callback
```

---

## Error Handling

```java
if(exception != null) {
    exception.printStackTrace();
}
```

---

## Real-World Use Cases

* Online commerce
* IoT platforms
* Social media systems
* Streaming applications

---

# Version 4: Key-Based Partitioning

## Learning Objective

Understand how Kafka distributes events among partitions.

---

## Business Scenario

A customer's transactions must remain in order.

---

## New Concepts

* Message key
* Partition assignment
* Ordering guarantees

---

## Core Code

```java
ProducerRecord<String,String> record =
        new ProducerRecord<>(
                topic,
                customerId,
                json);
```

---

## Partitioning Logic

```text
CustomerId
     |
Hash Function
     |
Partition Number
```

---

## Example

```text
CUST-101
     |
Partition 2
```

All events for the same customer go to the same partition.

---

## Why Is This Important?

Consider:

```text
TXN-100
TXN-101
TXN-102
```

Kafka guarantees ordering within a partition.

---

## Benefits

* Consistent routing
* Event ordering
* Better stream processing

---

## Real-World Keys

* Customer ID
* Account Number
* Device ID
* Order ID

---

# Version 5: Producer Batching

## Learning Objective

Learn how Kafka improves throughput using batching.

---

## Problem

Without batching:

```text
Message
Network Request

Message
Network Request

Message
Network Request
```

Too many network calls.

---

## New Concepts

* linger.ms
* batch.size
* compression

---

## Configuration

```java
props.put(
        "linger.ms",
        "100");
```

---

```java
props.put(
        "batch.size",
        "16384");
```

---

```java
props.put(
        "compression.type",
        "snappy");
```

---

## Internal Flow

```text
Message
Message
Message
Message
     |
Create Batch
     |
Single Request
     |
Broker
```

---

## Benefits

* Fewer network calls
* Better throughput
* Reduced CPU utilization
* Lower network usage

---

## Compression

Common values:

```text
none
gzip
snappy
lz4
zstd
```

---

## Real-World Use Cases

* Event ingestion platforms
* Clickstream systems
* Log aggregation
* Telemetry collection

---

# Version 6: Idempotent Producer

## Learning Objective

Learn how Kafka prevents duplicate messages.

---

## The Problem

Consider this sequence:

```text
Producer
    |
Send
    |
Timeout
    |
Retry
```

Question:

Did the broker receive the first request?

Maybe.

The producer does not know.

---

## Possible Outcome

```text
TXN-100
TXN-100
```

Duplicate event.

---

## New Concepts

* Idempotence
* Retries
* Sequence Numbers
* Exactly Once Foundations

---

## Configuration

```java
props.put(
        "enable.idempotence",
        "true");
```

---

```java
props.put(
        "acks",
        "all");
```

---

```java
props.put(
        "retries",
        "10");
```

---

## Internal Flow

```text
Producer
    |
Sequence Number
    |
Broker
    |
Duplicate Detection
```

---

## Benefits

* Safe retries
* Duplicate prevention
* Stronger delivery guarantees

---

## Why Payment Systems Need This

Imagine:

```text
Transfer ₹10,000
```

If a duplicate event occurs:

```text
Debit ₹10,000
Debit ₹10,000
```

This is unacceptable.

Idempotence helps prevent such situations.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

* Banking systems
* Stock trading
* Payment gateways
* Order management
* Financial reconciliation
